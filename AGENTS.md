# AGENTS.md

**Precedence:** the **closest `AGENTS.md`** to the files you're changing wins. Root holds global defaults only.

## Commands (unverified)
> Source: defaults — CI-sourced commands are most reliable

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START commands -->
| Task | Command | ~Time |
|------|---------|-------|
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END commands -->

> If commands fail, verify against Makefile/package.json/composer.json or ask user to update.

## Response Style
- Answer first, elaborate only if needed. No sycophantic openers ("Great question!", "Absolutely!").
- For yes/no or status questions, lead with the answer.
- Skip preamble. Match response length to task complexity.

## Workflow
1. **Before coding**: Read nearest `AGENTS.md` + check Golden Samples for the area you're touching
2. **After each change**: Run the smallest relevant check (lint → typecheck → single test)
3. **Before committing**: Run full test suite if changes affect >2 files or touch shared code
4. **Before claiming done**: Run verification and **show output as evidence** — never say "try again", "should work now", "tested", "verified", or "all green" without pasted command output in the same turn

## Heuristics (quick decisions)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START heuristics -->
| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Adding env var | Add to `.env.example` first |
| Adding dependency | Ask first - we minimize deps |
| Unsure about pattern | Check Golden Samples above |
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END heuristics -->

## Repository Settings
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START repo-settings -->
- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Merge strategy:** squash, merge, rebase
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END repo-settings -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START ci-rules -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END ci-rules -->

## Boundaries

### Always Do
- Run pre-commit checks before committing
- Add tests for new code paths
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): subject`
- Use **atomic commits** (one logical change per commit); preserve signatures, keep bisection useful
- **Show test output as evidence before claiming work is complete** — never say "try again", "should work now", "tested", "verified", or "all green" without pasted command output
- Before any edit, verify `pwd` resolves inside the intended repo worktree — not `.bare/`, not `~/.claude/skills/…`, not `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…` (those are read-only caches that get clobbered on update)
- For upstream dependency fixes: run **full** test suite, not just affected tests
- Force-push only with `--force-with-lease`

### Ask First
- Adding new dependencies
- Modifying CI/CD configuration
- Changing public API signatures
- Running full e2e test suites
- Repo-wide refactoring or rewrites
- Operations that touch >3 repos (produce a dry-run plan first)

### Never Do
- Commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- Modify vendor/, node_modules/, or generated files
- Push directly to main/master branch — open a PR
- Merge a PR before all review threads are resolved
- Squash commits during merge or rebase unless the user explicitly asked
- Edit installed skill/plugin cache paths (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, `**/.bare/**`) — always the source worktree
- Reply to review comments with bare "Addressed" or "Fixed" — cite the resolving commit SHA
- Delete migration files or schema changes
- Use `secrets: inherit` in reusable GitHub Actions workflows (pass secrets explicitly)

## Contributing (for AI agents)
- **Comprehension**: Understand the problem before submitting code. Read the linked issue, understand *why* the change is needed, not just *what* to change.
- **Context**: Every PR must explain the trade-offs considered and link to the issue it addresses. Disclose AI assistance if the project requires it.
- **Continuity**: Respond to review feedback. Drive-by PRs without follow-up will be closed.

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END module-boundaries -->

## Scoped AGENTS.md (MUST read when working in these directories)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START scope-index -->
- `./.github/workflows/AGENTS.md` — GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD automation
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END scope-index -->

> **Agents**: When you read or edit files in a listed directory, you **must** load its AGENTS.md first. It contains directory-specific conventions that override this root file.

## When instructions conflict
The nearest `AGENTS.md` wins. Explicit user prompts override files.

<!-- DOX:BEGIN (canonical: github.com/agent0ai/dox AGENTS.md — always-latest copy; safe to edit/extend the block below, e.g. fill in Child DOX Index) -->
# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md

## Child DOX Index

This project is not yet indexed. Before continuing you must scan the project, build the DOX tree and replace this message with the actual index. Go deep and scan files recursively to properly evaluate complexity and create nested DOX files where needed.

## Engineering baseline

This repo follows the baseline: `~/Code/700 systems/baseline` (https://github.com/antongulin/baseline, private).
Read `baseline/00-laws.md` first; pillars 01–07 hold the law (workspace, agents, project,
stacks, infra, delivery, knowledge). Answer standards questions from those files, not memory.
Anything missing or broken against the baseline is surfaced loudly — never skipped (law 2).
